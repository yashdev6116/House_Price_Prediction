Aim of the project:

The aim of the project "House Price Prediction" is to build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of houses based on various features. This project is valuable for real estate applications, helping stakeholders, such as buyers and sellers, make informed decisions about property transactions.

Objectives:

Data Collection:

Collect a dataset of housing-related features, including variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, and other relevant factors.
Ensure the dataset includes labeled target values representing the actual sale prices of houses.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Explore and understand the dataset, checking for missing values, outliers, and data distribution.
Clean the data by addressing any issues found during exploration.

Feature Engineering:

Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from the dataset.
Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model’s predictive performance.

Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

Model Selection:

Choose a regression model suitable for predicting house prices. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.

Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model’s performance using the testing dataset.
Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess how well the model predicts house prices.

Feature Importance Analysis:

Analyze the importance of different features in influencing house prices.
Use techniques such as feature importance plots to identify the most significant variables.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experiment with different hyperparameter values to find the optimal configuration for the chosen model.
Consider using techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.
